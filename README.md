# Arduino Nano Cased – Hammond ABS 1551PBK

## Description

A small Arduino Uno / Nano for neat installation in a Hammond *40x40x20mm* mini ABS housing **1551PBK**. Enables installation in flush-mounted boxes, for example. Requires an ATMega368 with Arduino bootloader.

The board can be programmed via an FTDI converter and the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/). To easily program the Arduino, I also developed a small [FTDI Adapter PCB](https://github.com/ArduinoSmarthomeDe/arduino-ftdi-adapter) that adapts a regular 2.54mm pin header from a *FTDI USB programmer* to the *Molex 1.25mm PicoBlade* socket on this Arduino.
